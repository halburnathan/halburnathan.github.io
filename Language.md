This document describes my process for studying the text in a piece of vocal music, using...

> Brahms Op. 64, No. 1 “An die Heimat”

...as example material for demonstrating the process in practice.

###### Summary of Steps

1. Translation
2. Diction
3. Synthesis
4. Musicology (optional)

## 1. Translation

First find high-level / general translations to get the gist of the poem’s meaning

web search (Google, Bing, etc.)
> “brahms an die heimat text translation”

Two resources which I use often:

###### The LiederNet Archive — lieder.net
1. Web search “lieder.net an die heimat”
2. Select (probably) top result
3. Next to “Available translation(s)” select ENG for English (or another, if preferred... Dutch & French are available in this case)
4. Select “Show text and translation together” so as to
compare the original text with its translation

###### Hyperion Records — hyperion-records.co.uk

1. Web search “hyperion records an die heimat”
2. Select (probably) top result
3. Scroll to detailed listing of movements
4. Select “Deutsch” to show original text only; select “English” to show the original with its translation I often write a general translation at the top of each system or page
