<br>

I have appeared as a baritone soloist in Handel’s *Messiah* with Spooky Goose Opera, Mendelssohn’s *Die erste Walpurgisnacht* with the Metropolitan Chorale, Handel’s *Jephtha* with the Seraphic Fire Professional Choral Institute, Fauré’s Requiem with the Wellesley College Choir, and Mozart’s Requiem and Coronation Mass with Camerata California.

I’ve performed and recorded with ensembles including Emmanuel Music, Church of the Advent, Cantata Singers, Ensemble Altera, Vox Futura, and the Pacific Chorale.

I am Artistic Director of Causeway Chamber Soloists along with soprano Angela Yam.

I’ve created arrangements for vocal jazz group GGN, the Davis Chamber Choir, and the Lounge Lizards.

I’ve composed original works such as *Two Peace Songs* for chorus & orchestra, *The Equivalence Principle* for a cappella chorus, and *Why, what is Tybalt?* for soprano & piano (featured in songSLAM NYC 2020).

I am half of neo-soul duo Dreamglow. Our most recent visual album juxtaposes art song, lo-fi beats, and COVID-19 news.
